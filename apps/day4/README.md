# Participants' data

## Context



## Rationale

1. We got a list of compounds. Even visually, we can see that this list contains a lot of cyclic molecules. We can use a drug-like score to filter them out.
1. In the Ersilia Model Hub, we find a drug-likeness model: [eos9sa2](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos9sa2). I have actually found a good model that we should certainly incorporate: https://github.com/SeonghwanSeo/DeepDL
1. In the Ersilia Model Hub, we found a few malaria models. Let's try MAIP and MMV models.
1. Also, it was mentioned that clearance and pharmacokinetic properties were critical for this disease area.
