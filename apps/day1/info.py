intro = "DAY 1 Activity: We will focus on plotting and comparing the chemical space of different datasets from literature."

questions = [
    "- Do the datasets overlap?",
    "- How similar are the nearest compounds to the chemical space we're interested in?",
    "- Are the trends consistent between the UMAP and PCA plots?", 
    "- How clustered is each dataset?",
    "- Are our observations what we expect to see?",
    "- Do we expect that a model produced from the data will be predictive for our chemical space of interest?"
