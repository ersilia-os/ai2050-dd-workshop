- [Day 1: Chemical space exploration](apps/day1)
- [Day 2: Building machine learning classifiers to predict bioactivity](apps/day2)
- [Day 3: Sampling the chemical space](apps/day3)
- [Day 4: Recap using the Ersilia Model Hub](apps/day4)

## Getting Started
To run the workshop apps, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can find the list of dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file. The requirements file is located in each subfolder (e.g. `apps/day1/`).

2. Run the following command to start the app for Day 1:
    ```
    streamlit run apps/day1/app.py
    ```

    Replace `day1` with the corresponding day number to run the app for a different day of the workshop.

That's it! You should now be able to access and interact with the workshop apps.
